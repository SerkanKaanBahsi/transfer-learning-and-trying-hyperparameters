# Description
* Transfer Learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For more information you can check the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning).
* For my image processing lesson project, I had to try different CNN models with different hyperparameters and I also had to try the success of Resnet50 model and VGG16 model on [Cinic-10 data](https://www.kaggle.com/mengcius/cinic10).
